In many applications one must solve linear systems of the form

<blockquote>
AX = B,
</blockquote>

where A is a nonsingular matrix.  The Solve suite contains static
methods for solving this and related systems.  Before describing these
methods, we will first discuss the use of inverses to solve systems.

<h3><a name="inverses"></a> Inverses and linear systems </h3>

<p>Back to:
<a href="00_Manual.html#mancont"> Main contents</a>,
<a href="06_Linsys.html"> Top of section</a>.

<p>The solution of the system AX = B can be written in the form X=
A<sup>-1</sup>B.  This suggests the following algorithm.

<blockquote>
<dl>
   <p><dt> 1. Compute C = A<sup>-1</sup>
   <p><dt> 2. Compute X = CB
</dl>
</blockquote>

This algorithm can be implement in Jampack as follows.

<blockquote>
<pre>
Zmat C = Inv.o(A);
Zmat X  = Times.o(C, B);
</pre>
</blockquote>

Or more succinctly:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Zmat X  = Times.o(Inv.o(A), B);
</pre>
</blockquote>

On the other hand, we can also solve the problem using the
function aib from the Solve suite.

<blockquote>
<pre>
Zmat X = Solve.aib(A, B);
</pre>
</blockquote>

The question is: Which is better?

<p>Without going into details, the method used by Solve is better
for two reasons.

<blockquote>
<dl>
   <p><dt> 1. It is faster.
   <p><dt> 2. It is numerically more stable.
</dl>
</blockquote>

For these reasons we recommend that the Jampack user substitute an
appropriate Solve method for an explicit inverse wherever possible.

For example, suppose that we have a formula of the form

<blockquote>
S = A<sub>22</sub> - 
         A<sub>12</sub>*A<sub>11</sub><sup>-1</sup>*A<sub>12</sub>.
</blockquote>

Instead of computing an inverse and using the standard matrix
functions to compute the matrix S, we can recognize that the matrix
A<sub>11</sub><sup>-1</sup>*A<sub>12</sub> is the solution of the
system A<sub>11</sub>*X=A<sub>12</sub>.  Hence if we write

<blockquote>
S = A<sub>22</sub> - A<sub>12</sub>*X,
</blockquote>

we have the following algorithm

<blockquote>
<pre>
Zmat X = Solve.aib(A11, A12);
Zmat S = Minus.o(A22, Times.o(A12, X));
</pre>
</blockquote>

In most instances when a matrix inverse appears in a formula, it can
be replaced with an appropriate Solve method.

<h3><a name="solve"></a> The Solve suite </h3>

<p>Back to:
<a href="00_Manual.html#mancont"> Main contents</a>,
<a href="06_Linsys.html"> Top of section</a>.

<p>In spite of the large number of individual routines in Solve, the
class methods can be described in a couple of tables.  (For a complete
listing of the calling sequences see the <a href="Jampack.Solve.html">
Java documentation</a> or the <a href="../Solve.java"> raw code</a>.)

<p>First, the Solve suite solves four kinds of linear systems
involving a nonsingular matrix A.  The following table gives the names
of the Solve methods, the systems they solve, and where the names come
from.

<p>
<center>
<table border>
<tr>
   <td> aib(A, B) </td> 
   <td> AX = B </td> 
   <td> A Inverse B </td>
<tr>
   <td> ahib(A, B) </td>
   <td> A<sup>H</sup>X = B </td> 
   </td> <td> A<sup>H</sup> Inverse B </td>
<tr>
   <td> bai(B, A) </td> 
   <td> XA = B </td> 
   <td> B Inverse A </td>
<tr>
   <td> bahi(B, A) </td>
   <td> XA<sup>H</sup> = B </td> 
   <td> B A<sup>H</sup> Inverse  </td>
</table>
</center>
<br>

(Ironically, although we have deprecated the use of inverses in
solving systems, we have used them to generate the names for our
methods.  A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of petty minds.)

<p>The second table lists the classes that each of four functions
supports. The matrix B is always a Zmat, so we need only list
the possible classes of A.

<p>
<center>
<table border>
<tr>
  <td> aib
  <td> Zmat   </td>
  <td> Zltmat </td>
  <td> Zutmat </td>
  <td> Zpsdmat </td>
<tr>
  <td> ahib
  <td> Zmat   </td>
  <td> Zltmat </td>
  <td> Zutmat </td>
  <td>        </td>
<tr>
  <td> bai
  <td> Zmat   </td>
  <td> Zltmat </td>
  <td> Zutmat </td>
  <td> Zpsdmat </td>
<tr>
  <td> bahi
  <td> Zmat   </td>
  <td> Zltmat </td>
  <td> Zutmat </td>
  <td>        </td>
</table>
</center>

<p>The methods ahib and bahi are not implemented Zpsdmats.  This is
natural, since positive definite matrices are Hermitian and the two
routines are therefore redundant.  Note that it is perfectly possible
to call ahib and bahi with a Zpsdmat for the first argument; however,
it will be treated as if the argument were a Zmat.

<p>In all the Solve methods the user is responsible for insuring that
the matrix in question is nonsingular.  If the matrix is singular or
nearly singular, the methods may throw a JampackException.  Owing to
rounding error, however, there is no guarantee that they will.  A
later version of Jampack will implement condition estimators to help
the user decide on the quality of a system.


<p>The Solve suite shows the powers of tag classes.  Triangular
systems can be solved much faster than general systems.  Consequently,
if a triangular matrix is properly tagged, Solve will automatically
take advantage of its triangularity.

<p>Solve also takes full advantage of the history feature.  Specifically,
to solve a general system, the Solve routines require a Zludpp
decomposition, which is expensive to compute.  However, once it
has been computed, it is put on the history list and can be reused.
Thus in the sequence

<blockquote>
<pre>
while (!converged){
   x = Solve.aib(A, x);
   x = Times.o(1/Norm.fro(x), x);
   ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

the first iteration of the loop will be expensive but the subsequent
interations will be cheap (unless A is altered in the latter part of
the loop).
