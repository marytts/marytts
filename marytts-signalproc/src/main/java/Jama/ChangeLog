	* Although SVD sometimes fails on cases m < n,
	the test code, apparently successfully, invokes
	SVD to compute rank on an m<n matrix. Deferring
	proposal to signal error on m < n, for now.
	Possible fix to generalize SVD to come later.

	* Updated CholeskyDecomposition to fix problem with scaling by
	diagonals; modified TestMatrix to better test this case.

2003-07-28 Cleve Moler
	* Updated SingularValueDecomposition to repair lack of convergience
	on rank deficient matrices.
	* Note that SVD still doesn't handle m < n
	Apparently this case can be handled by a pre-transposition,
	or more directly by a modification to the source, but this
	modified version isn't available yet.

	* Jama.Matrix print methods which create a NumberFormat, now set its
	Locale to US so that the reader will recognize them even when the
	default locale is not US.  Similar change to Jama.test.TestMatrix.
