/**
 * <p>
 * SimpleAudioRecorder: Recording to an audio file (simple version)
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Purpose: Records audio data and stores it in a file. The data is recorded in CD quality (44.1 kHz, 16 bit linear, stereo) and
 * stored in a .wav file.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Usage: java SimpleAudioRecorder choice="plain" -h java SimpleAudioRecorder choice="plain" audiofile
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Parameters: -h print usage information, then exit audiofile the file name of the audio file that should be produced from the
 * recorded data
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Bugs, limitations: You cannot select audio formats and the audio file type on the command line. See AudioRecorder for a version
 * that has more advanced options. Due to a bug in the Sun jdk1.3/1.4, this program does not work with it.

	 * TargetDataLine. The data read this way is then written to the passed File. Before writing of audio data starts, a header is
	 * written according to the desired audio file type. Reading continues untill no more data can be read from the
	 * AudioInputStream. In our case, this happens if no more data can be read from the TargetDataLine. This, in turn, happens if
	 * the TargetDataLine is stopped or closed (which implies stopping). (Also see the comment above.) Then, the file is closed
