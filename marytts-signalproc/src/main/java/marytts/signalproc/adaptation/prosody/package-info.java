 * <p>Prosody transformation algorithms for voice conversion.<br>
 * A prosody modification framework has been implemented which supports:<br>
 * - Mean and standard deviation transformation of f0<br>
 * - Sentence slope transformation<br>
 * </p>
 * <p>Mean and standard deviation transformation is the best method so far.<br>
 * Duration and energy transformation have not yet been implemented.<br>
