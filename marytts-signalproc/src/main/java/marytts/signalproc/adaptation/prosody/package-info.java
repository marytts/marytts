/**
 * Prosody transformation algorithms for voice conversion.<br>
 * A prosody modification framework has been implemented which supports:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Mean and standard deviation transformation of f0</li>
 *   <li>Sentence slope transformation</li>
 * </ul>
 * Mean and standard deviation transformation is the best method so far.<br>
 * Duration and energy transformation have not yet been implemented.
