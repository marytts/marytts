<p>A matrix decomposition is a factorization of a matrix into the
product of simpler matrices.  For example, Gaussian elimination with
partial pivoting when applied to a matrix A produces a
factorization of the form

<blockquote>
A = PLU,
</blockquote>

where P is a permutation matrix, L is a lower triangular matrix, and U
is an upper triangular matrix.  This decomposition is widely used in
the solution of linear systems--especially by the Solve suite.

<p>At the heart of most computations with dense matrices is a
decomposition.  Jampack provides classes implementing the more
commonly used decompositions.  The computation of the decomposition is
done by the class constructor.

<p>The uses of a particular decomposition are too varied to be
exhausted by a fixed set of methods.  Consequently, Jampack's
decomposition classes (with the exception of Zhqrd) have no methods of
their own, and its members are public for ready access.

<p>Certain matrix decompositions (ludpp, chol, and hqrd) are
distinguished by the fact that they can be saved for further use on
the history list of the matrix.  In particular the Solve suite makes
heavy use of this feature.  While a decomposition is on the history
list, it is hidden from applications outside the Jampack package.  For
more see <a href="02_Parameters.html#history"> Parameters.History </a> and
<a href="04_Matrices.html#history"> Matrices.Zmat</a>.

<h3> <a name="ludpp"></a> The LU decomposition (Zludpp) </h3>

<p>Back to:
<a href="00_Manual.html#mancont"> Main contents</a>,
<a href="10_Decomp.html"> Top of section</a>.

<p>The LU decomposition with partial pivoting is the decomposition
computed by Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting.
Specifically, any matrix A can be factored in the form

<blockquote>
A = PLU,
</blockquote>

where
<blockquote>
<dl>
   <p><dt> P is a permutation matrix,
   <p><dt> L is a lower triangular matrix with ones on its diagonal
        and with its subdiagonal elements less than one in magnitude,
   <p><dt> U is upper triangular.
</dl>
</blockquote>

This decomposition is widely used in computing solutions to linear
systems.

<p>The pivoted LU decomposition is implemented by the class Zludpp.
The matrix can be a general mxn Zmat, although square matrices are the
rule in most applications.  If m&gt;n, the L-factor is lower trapezoidal;
if m&lt;n, the U-factor is upper trapezoidal.

<p>The action of the permutation matrix P is specified by an integer
vector of pivot indices.  For more see the <a
href=11_Trans.html#pivot>Pivot suite</a>.

<p>The members of Zlupp are all public.

<blockquote>
<dl>
   <p><dt> public int nrl
      <dd>The number of rows in L

   <p><dt> public int ncl
      <dd>The number of columns in L

   <p><dt> public int nru
      <dd>The number of rows in U

   <p><dt> public int ncu
      <dd>The number of columns in U

   <p><dt> public int pvt[]
      <dd> The pivot array

   <p><dt> public Zltmat L
      <dd> The L factor

   <p><dt> public Zutmat U
      <dd> The U factor
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that L and U are of class Zltmat and Zutmat, subclasses
of Zmat that tag them as representing lower and upper triangular
matrices.


<p>The decomposition itself is computed in the constructor for Zlupp.

<blockquote>
<dl>
   <q><dt> Zludpp(Zmat A)
      <dd> Returns the Zludpp of A.
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>A caution.  The pivoted LU decomposition is always well defined,
hence Zludpp does not return and exception.  However, if A is
singular, the matrix U will be singular (or numerically will have
small diagonal elements), which may cause problems later.

<h3> <a name="chol"></a> The Cholesky decomposition (Zchol) </h3>

<p>Back to:
<a href="00_Manual.html#mancont"> Main contents</a>,
<a href="10_Decomp.html"> Top of section</a>.

<p> If A is a (Hermitian) positive semi-definite matrix, then
A can be factored in the form

<blockquote>
A = R<sup>H</sup>R,
</blockquote>

where R is upper triangular.  This factorization is called the
Cholesky decomposition of A.  The class Zchol implements the Cholesky
decomposition.

<p> The Cholesky decomposition is defined only if A is Hermitian and
satisfies x<sup>T</sup>Ax &gt;= 0 for all x.  The first condition is
checked by Zchol before any significant calculations can begin.  The
second condition is signaled by a failure of the algorithm for
computing the Cholesky decomposition.  The failure of either condition
causes a JampackExcpetion to be thrown.

<p>Here are the specifications for the Cholesky decomposition.

<blockquote>
<dl>
   <p><dt> public int n
      <dd> The order of A and R

   <p><dt> public Zutmat R
      <dd> The Cholesky factor of A

   <p><dt> public Zchol(Zmat A)
      <dd> Returns the Cholesky decomposition of A. <br>
           Throws JampackException if A is not Hermitian. <br>
           Throws JampackExcpetion if the decomposition does
           not exits
</dl>
</blockquote>

<h3> <a name="qrd"></a> The QR decomposition (Zqrd, Zhqrd) </h3>

<p>Back to:
<a href="00_Manual.html#mancont"> Main contents</a>,
<a href="10_Decomp.html"> Top of section</a>.

<p>For any mxn matrix A there is a unitary matrix Q such

<blockquote>
Q<sup>H</sup>A = R,
</blockquote>

where R is zero below its main diagonal.  Jampack provides two versions
of this QR decomposition.  The first is an explicit version in
which Q and R are returned as matrices.  The second version represents
Q as a product of Householder transformations.

<p>The explicit QR decomposition of an matrix mxn A is computed by the
class Zqrd.  Its data fields and constructor are

<blockquote>
<dl>
   <p><dt> public Zmat Q
      <dd> The Q factor of A

   <p><dt> public Zmat R
      <dd> The R factor of A

   <p><dt> public Zqrd(Zmat A)
      <dd> Returns the QR decomposition of A.
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p> The factored form of the QR decomposition of a mxn matrix A is
computed by the class Zhqrd (the "h" stands for Householder).  The
matrix Q is represented as the product of min(m,n) Householder
transformations, whose generating vectors are stored in an array of
Z1s.  Moreover, if m&gt;n, the the matrix R is made square by
stripping it of its trailing m-n rows.  Here are the specifications for
Zhqrd

<blockquote>
<dl>
   <p><dt> public int nrow
      <dd> The number of rows in A

   <p><dt> public int ncol
      <dd> The number of columns in A

   <p><dt> public int ntran
      <dd> the number of Householder transformations into
           which Q is factored

   <p><dt> public int Z1[] U
      <dd> An array containing the ntran vectors generating
           the Householder transformations.

   <p><dt> public Zutmat R
      <dd> The R-factor of A.  If nrow&gt;ncol then R is square
           of order ncol.  Otherwise R has the same dimensions as A.

   <p><dt> public Zhqrd(Zmat A)
      <dd> Returns the Householder QR decomposition of A.
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the Q-factor produced by Zhqrd is in factored form, the
class provides four methods for multiplying Q and its conjugate
transpose into a matrix.

<blockquote>
<dl>
   <p><dt> public Zmat qb(Zmat B)
      <dd> Returns QB.

   <p><dt> public Zmat qhb(Zmat B)
      <dd> Returns Q<sup>H</sup>B.

   <p><dt> public Zmat bq(Zmat B)
      <dd> Returns BQ.

   <p><dt> public Zmat bqh(Zmat B)
      <dd> Returns BQ<sup>H</sup>.
</dl>
</blockquote>

<h3> <a name="spec"></a> The spectral decomposition of a
     Hermitian matrix (Zspec )</h3>
   
<p>Back to:
<a href="00_Manual.html#mancont"> Main contents</a>,
<a href="10_Decomp.html"> Top of section</a>.

<p>For any Hermitian matrix A, there is a unitary matrix U such
that

<blockquote>
U<sup>H</sup>AU = D,
</blockquote>

where D is a real diagonal matrix.  The columns of U are eigenvectors
of A.  The corresponding diagonal elements of D are their eigenvalues.
The decomposition is called the spectral decomposition of A.  This
decomposition is implemented by the class Zspec.

<blockquote>
<dl>
   <p><dt> public Zmat U
      <dd> The unitary matrix of eigenvectors of A

   <p><dt> public Zdiagmat D
      <dd> The diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of A

   <p><dt> public Zspec (Zmat A)
      <dd> Returns the spectral decomposition of A. <br>
           Throws a JampackException if A is not Hermitian.
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that when real matrices are implemented, D will become a
Ddiagmat.

<h3> <a name="svd"></a>The singular value decomposition (Zsvd) </h3>

<p>Back to:
<a href="00_Manual.html#mancont"> Main contents</a>,
<a href="10_Decomp.html"> Top of section</a>.


<p>Let A be an mxn matrix m&gt;=n there are unitary matrices U and V
such that

<blockquote>
<pre>
U<sup>H</sup>AV = | S |
       | 0 |
</pre>
</blockquote>

where S = diag(s<sub>1</sub>,...,s<sub>n</sub>) with

<blockquote>
     s<sub>1</sub> &gt;= s<sub>2</sub> &gt;= ... &gt;= s<sub>n</sub> &gt;= 0.
</blockquote>

If m&lt;n the decomposition has the form

<blockquote>
<pre>
U<sup>H</sup>AV = | S  0 |,
</pre>
</blockquote>
where S is diagonal of order n.

<p>The diagonals of S are the singular values of A.  The columns of U
are the left singular vectors of A and the columns of V are the right
singular vectors.

<p>The singular value decomposition is implemented by the class
Zsvd.

<blockquote>
<dl>
   <p><dt> static int MAXITER = 30
      <dd> Limits the number of iterations in the SVD algorithm.

   <p><dt> public Zmat U
      <dd> The matrix of left singular vectors of X

   <p><dt> public Zmat V
      <dd> The matrix of right singular vectors of X

   <p><dt> public Zdiagmat S
      <dd> The diagonal matrix of singular values of X

   <p><dt> public Zsvd(Zmat A)
      <dd> Returns the SVD of A. <br>
           Throws a JampackException if MAXITER is exceeded.
</dl>
</blockquote>

<h3> <a name="hess"></a>Hessenberg form (Zhess) </h3>

<p>Back to:
<a href="00_Manual.html#mancont"> Main contents</a>,
<a href="10_Decomp.html"> Top of section</a>.


<p>If A is a matrix of order n, there is a a unitary matrix
U such that

<blockquote>
H = U<sup>H</sup>AU
</blockquote>

is upper Hessenberg; that is, H has the form illustrated below for
n = 6.

<blockquote>
<pre>
    | X X X X X X |
    | X X X X X X |
H = | O X X X X X |.
    | O O X X X X |
    | O O O X X X |
    | O O O O X X |
</pre>
</blockquote>
This reduction to Hessenberg form is implemented by the class Zhess.

<blockquote>
<dl>
   <p><dt> public Zmat H
      <dd> The Hessenberg form of A

   <p><dt> public Zmat U
      <dd> The unitary transformation that reduces A to H

   <p><dt> public Zhess(Zmat A)
      <dd> Returns the Hessenberg form of A. <br>
           Throws a JampackException if A is not square.
</dl>
</blockquote>

<h3> <a name="schur"></a>Schur form (Schur) </h3>

<p>Back to:
<a href="00_Manual.html#mancont"> Main contents</a>,
<a href="10_Decomp.html"> Top of section</a>.


<p> If A is a matrix of order n, there is a unitary matrix U
such that

<blockquote>
T = U<sup>H</sup>AU
</blockquote>

is upper triangular.  The matrix T is called a Schur form of A.  The
diagonals of T are eigenvalues of A and the corresponding columns of U
are its Schur vectors.  The decomposition is not unique--the order of
the eigenvalues on the diagonal of T can vary.  However, in most
applications any Schur form is sufficient.

<p> The class Schur implements this decomposition.

<blockquote>
<dl>
   <p><dt> public Zmat T
      <dd> A Schur form of A

   <p><dt> public Zmat U
      <dd> The unitary  transformation that reduces A to T

   <p><dt> public static MAXITER = 30
      <dd> Limits the number of iterations in the QR algorithm

   <p><dt> public Schur(Zmat A)
      <dd> Returns a Schur form of A. <br>
           Throws a JampackException if A is not square.
</dl>
</blockquote>

<h3> <a name="eig"></a>Eigenvalue-vector form (Eig) </h3>

<p>Back to:
<a href="00_Manual.html#mancont"> Main contents</a>,
<a href="10_Decomp.html"> Top of section</a>.


<p>Given a diagonalizable matrix A of order n, there is a nonsingular
matrix X such that

<blockquote>
D = X<sup>-1</sup>AX
</blockquote>

is diagonal.  The columns of X are eigenvectors of A corresponding to
the diagonal elements of D.  Eig implements this eigenvalue-vector
decomposition.

<blockquote>
<dl>
   <p><dt> public Zmat X
      <dd> The matrix of eigenvectors of A

   <p><dt> public Zdiagmat D
      <dd> The matrix of eigenvalues of A

   <p><dt> public Eig(Zmat A)
      <dd> Returns an eigenvalue-vector decomposition of A.</br>
           Throws a JampackException if A is not square.
</dl>
</blockquote>

The user should be aware that the eigenvalue-vector decomposition is
not necessarily stable.  In particular, the matrix X of eigenvectors
may be ill conditioned.
