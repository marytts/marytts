<p>Outlier elimantion algorithms for voice conversion.<br>
The aim of outlier elimination is to detect source and target pairs
that might result in reduced conversion performance or artefacts.<br>
The best working method so far has been the GaussianOutlierEliminator.<br>
This method fits a single Gaussian to the difference distributions of
various source and target acoustic features (LSFs, duration, f0,
energy).<br>
Then, the pairs with significant difference as compared to distribution
mean are eliminated.<br>
The voice conversion training step can also be set to eliminate too
close pairs, forcing an average amount of unlikeliness in the training
data.<br>
